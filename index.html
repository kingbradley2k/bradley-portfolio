  <h2>My Approaches</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>I assume all user input is hostile until proven otherwise.</strong><br>
      In practice, this means I never trust data simply because it comes from a user interface or a known client.
I design systems with the assumption that input can be manipulated, replayed, or malformed. This mindset guides my use of input validation, server-side checks, and defensive coding techniques to reduce the risk of injection flaws, broken logic, and unexpected behavior.

    <li>
      <strong>I identify trust boundaries before writing features.</strong><br>
     Before implementing functionality, I think about where trust begins and ends within the system.
I distinguish between trusted components (server, database) and untrusted ones (clients, external services). This helps me design authentication flows, authorization checks, and data flows that prevent privilege escalation, insecure direct object references, and unauthorized access.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>I think in abuse cases, not just happy paths.</strong><br>
      Rather than focusing only on how a feature is intended to be used, I also consider how it could be misused.
I ask questions like: What happens if this endpoint is called repeatedly? What if parameters are modified? What if a user skips steps?
This approach helps me uncover logic flaws, rate-limiting issues, and security gaps that might not be visible during normal use.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>I aim to build systems that fail safely.</strong><br>
      I design applications to handle errors in a controlled and predictable way.
This includes avoiding sensitive information in error messages, ensuring proper logging without exposing internal details, and maintaining system stability even when something goes wrong. The goal is to minimize information leakage while keeping the system resilient and observable
